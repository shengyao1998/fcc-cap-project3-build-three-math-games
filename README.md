# fcc-cap-project3-build-three-math-games

For this challenge, you need to create three math games using Python that do the following:

Scatter plot game
Randomly generate points on a graph and the player has to input the (x,y) coordinates
For added difficulty, make the graph larger
Algebra practice game
Generate one-step and two-step problems with random integer values and the player has to input the answer
Use positive and negative values. For added difficulty, make the numbers larger
Projectile game
Display a "wall" with random height and location. Player has to move sliders to adjust a parabolic path to clear the wall
For added difficulty, make a second level where players enter a, b, and c without sliders
Once you're done, submit the URL to the public Colab notebook on your Google drive.
